# Password Generator

A program that takes in user input to generate a password with constraints.
The process includes:

* Asking the user for a number of characters the password can be (no less than 8 and no more than 128)
* Asking the user what kind of characters to include (lowercase or uppercase letters, numerics or special characters)

The program then generates a password of the specified length and consists of all type of characters the user decided to include.
